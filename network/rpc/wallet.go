// from the database, it is loaded with the raw serialized bytes while the
// mempool has the fully deserialized structure.  This structure therefore will
// have one of the two fields set depending on where is was retrieved from.
// This is mainly done for efficiency to avoid extra serialization steps when
// possible.
